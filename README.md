# MTech_Thesis
This is the code repository for MTech thesis project titled, "Development of Optimization Techniques for Wireless Communication Systems", of Anand Kumar from Communication and Signal Processing branch at IIT Indore.

Here, the Gradient_DL_plots and Gradient_DL_Training are the codes for the Gradient based DL optimization method.

The "CNNLSTM1 (1)" is the code to train the RIS data using a CNN-LSTM model. The "ThetaOptimizerDataset.mat" provides the dataset for its training. The "SCA_CLSTM1 (1).m" is the code for full optimization for sumrate using the hybrid SCA and CNN-LSTM method. The trained wieghts from the CNN-LSTM model are saved in "ThetaOptimizerTrainedModel (1).mat".
